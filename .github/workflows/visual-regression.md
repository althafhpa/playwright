visual-test.yml workflow step by step:

Trigger Configuration
Runs on push to main branch
Runs on pull requests to main branch
Prepare Job
Runs on Ubuntu
Checks out code
Sets up Node.js 18
Generates worker configuration using a custom script
Creates a matrix output for parallel testing
Test Job
Depends on prepare job completion
Runs tests in parallel using matrix strategy:
Projects: macbook-safari, windows-chrome, windows-edge
URL chunks: 1 through 5 (splits testing across 5 parts)
Key steps:
Sets up Node.js
Installs dependencies
Installs Playwright with dependencies
Runs baseline tests for visual comparison
Runs comparison tests
Moves results to reports-runner directory
Uploads test results as artifacts
Merge Results Job
Runs after all test jobs complete
Downloads all test artifacts
Merges results using custom scripts
Generates a dashboard report
Uploads the final merged report as an artifact
Deploy to Pages Job
Final step that runs only on main branch
Downloads all test files
Deploys results to GitHub Pages using peaceiris/actions-gh-pages
Makes the visual regression test results publicly accessible
The workflow is designed for visual regression testing with:

Parallel execution for speed
Multiple browser/OS combinations
Automated result collection
Report generation
Public hosting of results
Each job builds upon the previous one, creating a complete pipeline from testing to public reporting.
